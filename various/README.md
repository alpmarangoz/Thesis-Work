# Examples from Adaptive Control Literature #
This folder includes Matlab - Simulink files that I have generated in order to gain more insight about various adaptive control techniques. 


* ADI Nonlin ODE Control: Folder includes simulations/calculations related to Adaptive Dynamic Inversion technique:
