# Thesis-Work
Matlab - Simulink codes that are related to the Ph.D. Thesis work

This repository includes all the Matlab-Simulink code developed during my Ph.D. studies in Middle East Technical University (Ankara, Turkey) Aerospace Engineering Department on "An Algorithmic Fault Tolerant Control for Architecture Without Actuator Redundancy". 


* example_problems: Solution of some nonlinear ODEs using the developed method in the thesis. These are presented in the introduction part of the thesis. 
* quadrotor_simulation: Simulation of quadrotor flight dynamics with propeller loss as the fault condition, together with attitude control system implementation.  
* robotarm_simulation: Simulation of two-link vertical robot arm and three-link horizontal robot arm dynamics with locked and free-swing type fault conditions, together with an underactuated control system implementation.
* various: Few examples from adaptive control literature that I had implemented.
